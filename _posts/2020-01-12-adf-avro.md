### Problem

Avro file format is the only format when capturing events from Event Hub. <br/>
However Avro files cannot be processed directly (To inspect schema) on Data Factory.

### Solution

Use a **Databricks activity** which will read Avro files into DataFrames, and eventually convert them into a CSV/JSON file. From there the schema can be inferred.
