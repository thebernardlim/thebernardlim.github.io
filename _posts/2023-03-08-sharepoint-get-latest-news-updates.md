As SharePoint Online is a SaaS, it is important for us (especially for SharePoint Administrators & IT Pros) to know what are the latest updates that are being released to the platform, rather than be randomly surprised or caught off guard.

Here are a couple of ways to stay updated.

## Official Microsoft 365 Roadmap

Microsoft has **Microsoft 365 Roadmap** page. Here you can filter the **Product** dropdown to only list SharePoint or any other M365 products.

## SharePoint Admin Center Message Center

Only applicable for SharePoint Administrators, the latest release updates can be found under the **Message Center** in the **SharePoint Admin Center**.

Note: SharePoint Admin Center can be accessed via [Office Admin](https://admin.microsoft.com/) or directly via _https://{yoursitename}-admin.sharepoint.com/_

## Blogs

There are a couple of blogs that do also post on the latest updates regarding M365 platforms.

Here are some:
