On completion of the first 30 days of Microsoft Azure's free trial, your **'Free Trial'** Azure Subscription will be disabled.
To fix this, the subscription needs to be changed to the **'Pay-As-You-Go'** plan instead of the 'Free Trial' plan which it is currently on.

# Steps

1. Access the [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) page. Click on **'Purchase Now'** button
